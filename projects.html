			***This is currently a work in progress***
			<br />
			<br />
			This is a project for <a href="http://lib.slu.edu/digital-humanities">Digital 
			Humanities at Saint Louis University</a> as an extension to the current works for 
			<a href="http://t-pen.org/TPEN/">T-PEN</a>. This is currently being worked on by 
			myself and Graison Day, a peer at SLU. T-PEN is a tool that is used for scholars to 
			easily create manifests of scanned images from old manuscripts and transcribe them, 
			then store them for access on the web through various tools (including T-PEN). We are 
			tasked with creating a different version of the tool that supports custom shapes that also 
			contain the ability to link and embed media relating to an annotation a user has made. 
			Originally, the tool only supported rectangular shapes as annotations. The tool conforms 
			to  <a href ="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/">IIIF</a> and
			<a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">OpenAnnotation</a> standards, and will 
			read in a <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#canvas">IIIF Canvas</a>, translate it to a usable and editable set of data on multiple 
			HTML5 Canvases, and then store the changes on a database in JSON-LD format that complies 
			with the standards listed above.
			
			This project is written in HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript, using jQuery, and HTML5 Canvas.

			A project I did with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zchrylcs">
			Zach Lucas</a> in my web graphics class senior year. We had about 4 weeks to 
			recreate a small version of the game Katamari Damacy, in which you control a 
			ball that rolls around, and as you intersect with objects, your ball 
			picks them up - and consequently grows!
			
			Written in JavaScript using the Three.js library for WebGL.

			Lead God, or Bullet Kin, is a useful page for players of Enter The Gungeon, 
			a successful rogue-like bullet hell game that I enjoy playing. A friend of mine,
			<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyensimon">Simon Nguyen</a>, had the idea
			to create a page similar to that of another (for another game),
			which did the same task: create a page 
			with images to all of the items in the game, with all of their information, so that 
			players could search through them easily to discover what they did in-game. He 
			asked me to assist him in creating the page, and I obliged!
			
			Written in HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript, using jQuery and Isotope.

			<br />
			<br />
			This is an alpha version of a now finished project that essentially allows the user to upload an image (or not) 
			and paint on it. It is written using HTML5's canvas and JavaScript. 
			Most of the code you see here is starter code provided by 
			<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a>.
			However, I have used this as a jumping-off point so that I can simply modify 
			the paint environment to add all the functionality my client has requested. 
			Current modifications include auto-closing a free-drawn path, filling the 
			path with a transparent, colored field, and resizing the image the user 
			inputs to the canvas size. 
			<br />
			<br />
			**Note: Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I am not allowed to speak about 
			the entirety of the requirements. This also means I can't post a more updated version.**

			This was a project that I worked on in a group of 4 for my software engineering course.
			It is a Google Chrome browser extensions that allows a user to add songs from 
			YouTube links into their own playlists and save them, and allows continuous 
			play, pause, seek, and track forward/previous functionality. This is so that 
			browser users can play audio from their favorite YouTube videos without having
			to keep a YouTube tab open or create playlists on YouTube linked to an account.
			The extension only loads the needed audio.
			
			Below are some diagrams we were required to make for the course for our 
			project. Here are some of the ones I made:
			
			Below, in order: Data Flow Diagram, Entity Class Diagram, Use Case 
			Diagram, State Chart

			This was the final project for my Object Oriented Design course. It was 
			created without any external existing resources - all graphics, classes and code 
			were created by me. 
			<br />
			<br />
			The game is simple: use the arrow keys to move your character around the map.
			You must collect all the keys to open the color-coordinated doors to reach the 
			green goal. However, the map seems impossible - but it is not!
			<br />
			<br />
			**Note: I do not have a .jar file of this project at the moment - 
			in the .rar below, you can see all the .java files associated with the 
			project. The file runs from the "MazeGame.java" file in an IDE such as 
			Eclipse.**

			This was a midterm project for my Object Oriented Design course. It 
			involves creation of images using the Graphics package provided in the 
			JRE, event listeners, and GUI elements. We initially were provided with 
			the White game pieces, but they could not double jump or king, and the 
			game could not be reset, until I implemented it.

			My earliest project!
			<br />
			<br />
			This one took quite a bit of self-learning. GUI elements, action listeners, and 
			stream writers/readers were completely foreign to me during this project, 
			so much of this was very difficult to me - especially since I had only 
			a year or so of programming experience in Java. This was completed in 2012.
