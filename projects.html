			<br />
			This is a project that essentially allows the user to upload an image (or not) 
			and paint on it. It is written using HTML5's canvas and JavaScript. 
			Most of the code you see here is starter code provided by 
			<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/19_paint.html">Eloquent JavaScript</a>.
			However, I have used this as a jumping-off point so that I can simply modify 
			the paint environment to add all the functionality my client has requested. 
			Current modifications include auto-closing a free-drawn path, filling the 
			path with a transparent, colored field, and resizing the image the user 
			inputs to the canvas size.
			<br />
			<br />
			**Note: Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I am not allowed to speak about 
			the entirety of the requirements.**

			This project is simply a concept at the moment. I only wanted to add this here 
			to demonstrate some of the various software engineering techniques my group and 
			I are using to layout the design portion of this project. The project will 
			eventually allow a Chrome user to download this extension and be able to edit 
			playlists of media from YouTube, only the extension will act as the media player, 
			and will serve as an audio player only.

			This was the final project for my Object Oriented Design course. It was 
			created without any external existing resources - all graphics, classes and code 
			were created by me. 
			<br />
			<br />
			The game is simple: use the arrow keys to move your character around the map.
			You must collect all the keys to open the color-coordinated doors to reach the 
			green goal. However, the map seems impossible - but it is not!
			<br />
			<br />
			**Note: I do not have a .jar file of this project at the moment - 
			in the .rar below, you can see all the .java files associated with the 
			project. The file runs from the "MazeGame.java" file in an IDE such as 
			Eclipse.**

			This was a midterm project for my Object Oriented Design course. It 
			involves creation of images using the Graphics package provided in the 
			JRE, event listeners, and GUI elements. We initially were provided with 
			the White game pieces, but they could not double jump or king, and the 
			game could not be reset, until I implemented it.

			My earliest project!
			<br />
			<br />
			This one took quite a bit of self-learning. GUI elements, action listeners, and 
			stream writers/readers were completely foreign to me during this project, 
			so much of this was very difficult to me - especially since I had only 
			a year or so of programming experience in Java. This was completed in 2012.
