					About me

						Welcome! My name is Benjamin Beshel - you can call me Ben. I 
						grew up in Louisiana and was forced to move due to Hurricane
						Katrina in 2005, at which time my family and I decided to settle 
						down in St. Louis, Missouri. During my time at Lindbergh High School, 
						I realized my interest in computer science and programming. 
						<br />
						<br />
						My confidence in myself has only grown since the hardships of moving at a young 
						age unexpectedly, which has caused me to become independent when I need to be.
						However, I also try to realize the views 
						and opinions of others so that I can continue to learn and grow as a person. 
						I find that I enjoy working with people who have a similar passion for 
						learning new things on their own - 
						it helps create a strong bond on a team.
						<br />
						<br />
						On my free time, I enjoy playing and watching video games, discovering and creating new music, and spending 
						time with friends. In particular, I like to <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/">speedrun</a> video games, 
						and I lean towards the competitive side 
						of gaming, such as Counter-Strike:Global Offensive (my favorite streamer is <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/summit1g">summit1g</a>). 
						I listen to lots of music, and lately, I've had an interest in progressive metal and video game soundtracks (preferably retro). 
						Although I haven't worked much with it, computer security has recently piqued my interest, and have since become more conscious 
						of how vulnerable we all really are on the internet (it's freaky, and sometimes, ignorance really is bliss!)

					Programming Experience Overview
				</div>
				
				<p>
				I've been programming since my Junior year of high school, where I began 
				programming in Java for AP Computer Science. In my Senior year, I created a 
				dossier for an independent program, used for aiding AP Chemistry students in 
				their studies, as well as help archive old AP tests 
				(this can be viewed <a href="projects.html">here</a>, or by clicking the "Projects" link
				at the top of this page).
				AP credit was received, which allowed me to skip an intro course of 
				Computer Science at Saint Louis University.
				<br />
				<br />
				
				Since then, I've done various projects through courses at SLU, which included 
				learning multiple languages and working in various programming environments. 
				A list of languages and code examples are 
				available <a href="code.html">here</a>, and via the "Code" link above.
				
				Currently, I have an interest in web development, and am working with and
				leading a team in 
				software engineering to create a Chrome extension that acts as a music playlist,
				but uses YouTube's media to get the audio data without displaying the
				video. Alongside this, I have been working with a client to create a 
				HTML5 Canvas application that is a prototype for her idea, which will
				be completed in May. It is intended to show investors a demonstration and proof of 
				concept, which will help
				her company begin development on the full project to begin selling to vendors.
